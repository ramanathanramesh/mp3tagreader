# mp3tagreader
MP3 Tag Reader is a C-based project that reads and edits ID3 metadata in MP3 files. It extracts details like Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre, and Comment by parsing the ID3 header and frames. This project improved my understanding of file handling, binary data processing, and structured formats in C.
